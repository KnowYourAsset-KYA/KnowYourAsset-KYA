# Know Your Asset (KYA)

KYA is a collaborative multi-body industry initiative to provide a framework for the standardization and unification of token metadata. The objective of KYA is to allow for greater interoperability and compatibility of token metadata. Adoption of a standard can then lead to the development of tools and processes that build transparency, trust and accountability for stakeholders.
