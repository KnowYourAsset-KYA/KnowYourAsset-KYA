# TokenFundamentals

Token Fundamentals is a collaborative multi-body industry initiative to provide a framework for the standardization and unification of token metadata. The objective of Token Fundamentals is to allow for greater interoperability  and compatibility of token metadata. Adoption of a standard can then lead to the development of tools and processes that build transparency, trust and accountability for stakeholders.

The founding members of the Token Fundamentals Working Group are:
Swarm
Security Token Network

This document is a request for comment to identify, list and describe the properties of a tokenâ€™s metadata, categorized into logical divisions that may or may not be applicable to any specific token.

Application and implementation of Token Fundamentals to ensure verification of authorship and data authenticity is a discussion separate to the development of the standard itself.
